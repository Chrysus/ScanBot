# ScanBot
ScanBot is a document "scanner" written in Python with OpenCV.  Just to be clear, this does *not* use a flatbed scanner to scan images.  ScanBot uses an attached camera to detect documents and capture an image of the document.

You will need to install OpenCV with Python bindings (see links down below for more info).


To use: simply launch ScanBot, wait a few seconds for your camera to focus, then place a document in the camera capture area.  ScanBot will detect the document, capture an image of the doc, and save the image to a file.  That's it.  Repeat as often as desired.  Press 'q' to exit.

Enjoy!
